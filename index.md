### Project#2
Description: The perpose of this project was to teach us how to create and save our changes in a git repo file. We learned how to commit our initial code, any subsequent changes to it, and how to create a .gitignore file. For the javascript portion we had to code two functions. The first one was a function called getRandomLetter() which returns a single, random, lowercase letter. The second on was a function called getRandomString(minLength, maxLength) that returns the length of a randomly generated string between 10 and 20 characters long. It also draws some functionality from the previous function.
